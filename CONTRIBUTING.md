# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Untitled Roguelike Framework.
The framework is in the very early stages, and there's a ton of work to do.

Following these guidelines signals your intent to make serious, valuable
contributions to the project. By demonstrating this respect to the developers
managing the project, we commit to working with you with full respect as well.

We are looking for early contributors with a few skill sets- documentation, C#
optimization/standardization, writing tests, unity client improvements, bug
reports, feature requests, and most importantly, roguelike developers interested
in testing the framework out by building new games. We would love to hear about
your 7-Day Roguelike built on URF!

This project does not intend to be more than a flexible base feature set. Please
do not request features that simply add variety or content to the demo game
without extending the base feature set.

## Ground Rules

Please be respectful to all involved. We value diversity and people from all
backgrounds.

We are still developing technical guidelines for the project, so be mindful that
a variety of styles may coexist. However, aim to replicate or standardize the
existing code style in a file.

If you would like to write a full feature, please create an issue and host a
discussion on the feature.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
As of November 2022, we're still working through foundational features.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_
series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code
has changed and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started

First, to limit bureaucracy, we don't have a Contributor License Agreement or
any sort of lawyer-sanctioned way of approving new contributors. With that in
mind, please make sure that your contributions are yours to give and can be
released under an MIT license.

Tests are preferred for submissions. However, as of November 2022, the codebase
test coverage is very low, and we will not reject contributions based on a lack
of tests.

For something bigger than a two-line fix:

1. Create a fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    a. Read this document again.
    b. Send a pull request.

## How to report a bug

At this time, we do not consider security concerns to be different from other
bugs. We will reevaluate this policy periodically.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of Unity are you using?
2. What version of URF are you using?
3. Was this observed in the editor, a build, or both?
4. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
5. What did you do?
6. What did you expect to see?
7. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

URF is meant to be a flexible, pluggable roguelike base project with a strong
client-server architecture. Please consider these merits when suggesting a
feature.

If you are considering a feature for URF and want to suggest it, please head
over to our issue list and create a new issue. In the issue, explain the feature
and why you want it. You may also consider using the discussions page on Github
to brainstorm before suggesting.

## Code review process

After you make a pull request, a maintainer will review your PR in 1-2 weeks and
either merge the PR or provide feedback on improvements.

## Community

We do not currently have any community channels available.
