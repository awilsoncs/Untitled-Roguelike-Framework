# Untitled Roguelike Framework (URF)
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://makeapullrequest.com)

URF is a flexible framework for building turn-based, tile-based games in Unity.

## Who is URF for?

URF is currently aimed at two broad groups of developers:

* Experienced roguelike developers who are looking to move to Unity
* C#/Unity developers looking to build a roguelike without doing *all* of the base work.
* Anyone interested in wading through a new and evolving project.

In the future, we also aim to support designers with a highly plug-and-play framework similar to software like the *RPGMaker* series.

Also, while the target gameplay is traditional roguelikes, the framework is perfectly suitable for other types of turn/tile-based games (e.g. Tactics).

## What are some core features of URF?

* A strong client / rules server split. URF aims to serve both sides, but either should be replaceable.
* Flexible visual representation. The client framework allows a designer to use 2D sprites or 3D models as they choose.
* ECS design. Adding new systems and types of components is a piece of cake.
* Pluggability. If you don't like a way the engine works, its easy enough to write a custom module and use that instead.

## Is there a roadmap?

Not yet. However, you can find some milestones on the Issues page.

* [(Alpha) Roguelike Tutorial Feature Parity](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/milestone/1)
* [(Beta) Ports and Adapters](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/milestone/2)

However, we fully expect to stretch this timeline out. As soon as a roadmap is available, it will appear here.

## Are there any tutorials or guides?
Oof, no. As URF is still in pre-alpha, things are changing way too fast to write much documentation. However, once we reach Beta, we will begin to create learning materials.

## I want to see some code but don't know much about Unity projects!

[This directory is the main souce directory](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/tree/main/Assets/Scripts).

## I want to talk about URF!

Please do! You can use our [discussion page](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/discussions) for now. At some point between Alpha and Beta, we will expand the community offerings.

## I want to contribute!

You're an angel. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), which should walk you through everything you want to know.
