URF is a flexible framework for building turn-based, tile-based games in Unity.

## Who URF is for

URF is currently aimed at three broad groups of developers:

- Experienced roguelike developers who are looking to move to Unity
- C#/Unity developers looking to build a roguelike without doing _all_ of the
  base work
- Anyone interested in wading through a new and evolving project

In the future, we also aim to support designers with a highly plug-and-play
framework similar to software like the _RPGMaker_ series.

Also, while the target gameplay is traditional roguelikes, the framework is
perfectly suitable for other types of turn/tile-based games (e.g. Tactics).

## Core features of URF

- A strong client/rules server split. URF aims to serve both sides, but either
  should be replaceable
- Flexible visual representation. The client framework allows a designer to use
  2D sprites or 3D models as they choose
- ECS design. Adding new systems and types of components is a piece of cake.
- Pluggability. If you don't like the way the engine works, it's easy enough to
  write a custom module and use that instead

## Roadmap

There isn't a roadmap yet. However, you can find some milestones on the Issues page.

- [(Alpha) Roguelike Tutorial Feature Parity](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/milestone/1)
- [(Beta) Ports and Adapters](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/milestone/2)

However, we fully expect to stretch this timeline out. As soon as a roadmap is
available, it will appear here.

## Tutorials and Guides

As URF is still in pre-alpha, things are changing way too fast to write much
documentation. However, once we reach Beta, we will begin to create learning materials.

## Navigation for non-Unity developers

This directory is the [main source directory](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/tree/main/Assets/Scripts).
Everything should be in .cs files.

## Community

You can use our
[discussion page](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/discussions)
for now. At some point between Alpha and Beta, we will expand the community offerings.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awilsoncs/Untitled-Roguelike-Framework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
which should walk you through everything you want to know.
